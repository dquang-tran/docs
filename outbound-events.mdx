The goal of carrier sales conversations is to collect a bid from the carrier and possibly book the load. FleetWorks can send bid events to your TMS when carriers submit bids on loads. The webhook payload includes the bid amount, carrier details, and contact information. We support customizable formatting to match your specific needs.

<Note>
  Configure your webhook URL in the FleetWorks dashboard to receive these events.
