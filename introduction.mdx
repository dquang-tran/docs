## Overview

FleetWorks is an AI-powered freight logistics platform that automates carrier communications and transactions. Our platform seamlessly integrates with your Transportation Management System (TMS) to vet carriers, relay load information, negotiate rates, and book loads. The system handles the complete workflow - from initial carrier outreach through rate confirmation - via automated phone and email communications while keeping your TMS updated in real-time.

## How It Works

While your TMS sends load information to FleetWorks through webhooks, our system will feed offers and book loads through your system.
