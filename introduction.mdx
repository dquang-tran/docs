## Overview

FleetWorks is an AI-powered freight logistics platform that automates carrier sales communications. Our platform connects with your TMS through webhooks, allowing us to provide load details and receive bids through our AI phone+email systems.

## How It Works

While your TMS sends load information to FleetWorks through webhooks, our system will feed offers and book loads through your system.
