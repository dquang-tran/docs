## Overview

FleetWorks is an AI-powered freight logistics platform that automates carrier sales communications. Our platform seamlessly integrates with your Transportation Management System (TMS) to streamline load management, automate carrier outreach, and process bids through phone and email systems.

## How It Works

While your TMS sends load information to FleetWorks through webhooks, our system will feed offers and book loads through your system.

   - [Load Events](/api-reference/ingestion/load-events-webhook)
   - [Carrier Events](/api-reference/ingestion/carrier-events-webhook)
3. Configure your TMS to receive event webhooks from FleetWorks.
   - [Bid Events](/events/bids)
   - [Call Events](/events/calls)
