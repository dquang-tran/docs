## Introduction

Welcome to FleetWorks! This guide will walk you through the process of integrating our system with your Mcleod setup. This integration will allow you to create a new user and set up rapid alerts to send JSON data to a dedicated webhook endpoint upon load creation/updates. Note that each version of Mcleod is slightly different, so it’s possible that not all the steps in this doc would completely coincide with what you see in your version.&#x20;

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

* Administrative access to your Mcleod system.

* Your FleetWorks API token.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Creating a New User in Mcleod

1. Log in to Mcleod Admin Panel:

   1. Navigate to your Mcleod admin panel.

   2. Enter your administrative credentials to log in.

2. Navigate to User Management:

   1. From the main dashboard, go to the **Administration** section.

   2. Click on **User Management**.

3. Add a New User:

   1. Click on the Add New User button.

   2. Fill in the required details:

      1. **Username**: Choose a username for the new user.

      2. **Email**: Enter the email address associated with this user.

      3. **Password**: Create a strong password.

      4. **Role**: Assign the appropriate role (e.g., API User or Integration User).

4. Set Permissions:

   1. Ensure the new user has the necessary permissions to access and modify load information. Typically, this includes Read and Write access to the Load Management module.

   2. Save the new user.

### 2. Setting up Rapid Alerts

1. Navigate to Rapid Alerts

   1. Dispatch -> Rapid Alert -> Rapid Alert Scheduler

2. Create a new Table Change Alert:

   1. Click on the `Add` button.

   2. Choose `Table Change Alert` as the alert type for this alert.

   3. Change `Alert at` to `Both`.&#x20;

   4. Now select `Remote Profile` and create a new profile. Set the format to be JSON. If you don’t see the remote profile field, it might mean your Mcleod version is slightly older.&#x20;

   5. Click on `Communication profile`. Set **Type** to be `External API` or `URL` (Different instances of Mcleod tend to have different fields, but either of the 2 would work).

   6. In the new window, enter the webhook url: [`https://api.fleetworks.ai/api/webhooks/loads/events`](https://api.fleetworks.ai/api/webhooks/loads/events)

   7. Click on `Authentication`. Select type Token and enter the FW provided UUID token.

   8. Click on Headers (Not Auth Headers). Put “Bearer \<UUID token>” as a “Authorization” header.&#x20;

   9. Optional (if McLeod requires this): In Miscellaneous tab, set the Local directory \<mcleod\_api\_url>/ws/doc and check “Use default directory”.&#x20;
