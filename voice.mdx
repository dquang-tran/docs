Our system combines speech recognition, natural language processing, and voice synthesis to provide carriers with immediate access to load information and collect bids. By automating these transactional calls, we ensure no opportunities are missed while giving carriers a responsive, professional experience without hold times.

## How It Works

The voice AI system operates through three core components, each optimized for transportation industry use cases:

1. **Speech-to-Text**: Our transcription model is specifically trained on thousands of real phone conversations between brokers and carriers, allowing it to understand the unique cadence and terminology of logistics discussions. When carriers speak, we can accurately capture industry-specific terms like equipment types and locations, even through background noise or regional accents. The system excels at picking up critical details that matter in transportation - whether it's a DOT number mentioned in passing, an MC number being verified, or specific load requirements being discussed.

2. **AI Processing**: The transcribed text is processed by our proprietary language models that are specifically trained on millions of carrier-broker conversations. These models understand:
   - Load matching preferences and constraints
   - Rate negotiations and market conditions
   - Equipment specifications and requirements
   - Pickup/delivery scheduling nuances
   - Transportation regulations and compliance

3. **Text-to-Speech**: The AI's response is converted back to natural-sounding speech, maintaining a professional tone that aligns with industry standards. Our voices are calibrated to clearly communicate complex load details, rates, and scheduling details.

The entire system is built on deep domain expertise in freight transportation, allowing our AI to handle nuanced conversations about lane preferences, detention times, accessorial charges, and other industry-specific topics that general-purpose AI systems struggle with.
