FleetWorks' voice AI system operates through three core components working together in real-time:

### 1. Speech-to-Text (Listening)
When a carrier or broker speaks, their raw audio is captured and instantly transcribed into text. This transcription happens with minimal latency to enable natural conversation flow.

### 2. AI Processing (Understanding & Deciding) 
The transcribed text is processed by our specialized Large Language Models (LLMs) that:
- Understand the context and intent
- Access relevant load and carrier information 
- Make decisions on how to respond
- Follow conversation protocols

### 3. Text-to-Speech (Speaking)
The AI's response is converted back into natural-sounding speech that is streamed to the caller. Our text-to-speech engine is optimized for clarity and human-like delivery.

This entire process happens in under 700ms, enabling fluid, real-time conversations. The system continuously streams between all components to maintain natural dialogue pacing and turn-taking.

FleetWorks orchestrates these components while adding industry-specific optimizations for freight logistics conversations, carrier compliance checks, and TMS integrations.

### Advanced Voice AI Features

Our voice AI system includes several advanced capabilities that enhance the natural conversation experience:

- **Intelligent Endpointing**: Uses audio and text analysis to detect when a user has finished speaking, enabling quick responses without interrupting mid-thought

- **Interruption Handling**: Detects and appropriately responds when users need to interject or correct the conversation flow

- **Background Noise Filtering**: Employs real-time noise cancellation to ensure clear audio quality even in noisy environments like truck cabs or warehouses

- **Natural Speech Patterns**: Incorporates conversational elements like "umm", "ah", and other filler words to maintain a natural dialogue flow

These work together to create human-like conversations.
