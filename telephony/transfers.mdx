The FleetWorks AI agent is equipped to handle various transfer scenarios intelligently during carrier conversations:

### Person-Specific Transfers
When a carrier requests to speak with a specific person (e.g., "Can I talk to John Smith?"), the agent:
- Recognizes the named individual
- Validates if the person exists in the system
- Initiates a direct transfer to that person's extension

### Department/General Line Transfers 
The agent can identify when a carrier needs to be transferred to general departments like:
- Accounting
- Claims
- Dispatch

### Load-Specific Transfers
For load-related inquiries, the agent:
- Identifies the specific load being discussed
- Determines the assigned carrier sales representative or team
- Routes the call to the appropriate rep or team handling that load

    end

    FleetWorksAI->>Broker: Communicate Transfer Reason and Send Notification
    FleetWorksAI->>Carrier: Complete Handoff
    FleetWorksAI->>Broker: Connect Call
```

When the transfer happens, the agent communicates the reason for transfer and relevant details to the intended recipient to create a smooth handoff experience before connecting the parties.
