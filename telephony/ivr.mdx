When making outbound calls, the FleetWorks voice agent is capable of navigating Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems to reach the intended recipient. The agent can handle both voice-based and keypad-based IVR systems:

### Voice IVR Navigation

For IVR systems that accept voice commands, the agent can:

* Listen to and understand menu options

* Provide clear voice responses

* Navigate multiple menu levels to reach the right department or person

### DTMF Navigation

For IVR systems requiring keypad input (DTMF - Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency):

* The agent can send the appropriate digit tones

* Navigate numeric menu options

* Enter required information like account numbers or extensions

FleetWorks has built-in support for both voice and DTMF navigation methods, automatically detecting and using the appropriate method based on the IVR system encountered.

You only need to instruct the agent who to reach when encountering an IVR system. The agent will automatically handle navigating the menus and inputting the appropriate responses to connect with the specified person or department. The more detailed you are in the instructions, the better the agent will perform.&#x20;
