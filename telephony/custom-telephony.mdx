FleetWorks supports integration with your existing telephony infrastructure through two primary methods:

## Elastic SIP Trunking (Recommended)

Elastic SIP Trunking provides a flexible way to connect your existing phone system to FleetWorks' AI agents. It acts as a bridge between:

- Your PBX or VoIP phone system
- The public telephone network (PSTN)
- FleetWorks' AI calling infrastructure

We recommend using elastic SIP trunking because it:
- Requires minimal changes to your existing setup
- Scales automatically with your call volume
- Provides enterprise-grade reliability and security
- Enables both inbound and outbound calling capabilities

### How It Works

1. **Create SIP Trunk**
   - Set up a SIP trunk with your provider
   - Configure termination settings for outbound calls
   - Set up origination settings using FleetWorks' SIP server

2. **Configure Numbers** 
   - Move your existing numbers to the SIP trunk
   - Or purchase new numbers through your provider

3. **Import to FleetWorks**
   - Import your numbers to our platform
   - Provide the termination SIP URI
   - Add authentication if required

Once configured, you can use these numbers just like FleetWorks-provided numbers - make calls through our dashboard or API.

## Direct SIP Endpoint Integration

For more complex telephony setups or providers that don't support elastic SIP trunking, you can integrate directly with our SIP endpoints.

This method requires:
- Your system to handle call routing
- Integration with your telephony provider's API
- Registering calls with FleetWorks to obtain endpoints

### Implementation Steps

1. Register the call with FleetWorks to get a `call_id`
2. Use the `call_id` to construct the SIP endpoint
3. Route the call to the FleetWorks endpoint

The FleetWorks AI agent will then handle the call using your specified configuration.

## Security Considerations

When setting up either integration method:

- Use secure authentication methods
- Implement proper access controls
- Follow telephony security best practices
- Monitor call activity for unusual patterns
