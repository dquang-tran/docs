## Access Token

A valid authorization token is required in the request headers to successfully interact with our APIs.
To gain access to the API, you can reach out to development team.

## Using the Access Token

After obtaining the token, include it in the `Authorization` header of each request to the API endpoint.

```bash
'Authorization': 'Bearer <token>'
```
