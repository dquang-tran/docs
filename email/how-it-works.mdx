Our system integrates with your email infrastructure to handle carrier inquiries, negotiations, and bookings.

## How It Works

The email system processes carrier communications through several key components:

1. **Email Processing**: Integrates with your email systems to:
   - Monitor inboxes for carrier messages
   - Maintain conversation context across email threads
   - Handle attachments and documents

2. **Carrier Verification**: Validates carrier information by checking:
   - MC/DOT numbers
   - Safety ratings
   - Insurance coverage
   - Past performance data

3. **Load Management**: Handles load-related communications:
   - Shares appropriate load details
   - Negotiates rates based on market data
   - Matches carrier capacity to available loads
   - Manages booking confirmations

4. **Documentation**: Processes required paperwork:
   - Generates rate confirmations
   - Updates your TMS with booking details
   - Coordinates pickup/delivery

The system maintains professional communication while efficiently moving loads from inquiry to booking, keeping your team updated through your existing workflows.
